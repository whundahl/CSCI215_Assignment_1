    <h3>My Experiences in the CIS program at The College of Charleston:</h3>
    <p>In my short time as a CIS major at The College of Charleston I have found my experiences to be nothing but positive, aquiring life skills and an understanding of web design. I have applied this knowledge to build several websites for organizations. Unfortunatly my coding experience is small and I look forward to learing more about responsive web design in upcoming courses, including CSCI 215.</p>
